            Biology impacts the lives of everyone and everything. As stated before, biology helps us better understand the world we live in, the species that live in this world, and how thongs function/interact with each other. Biology has a impact that influences human health,  the environment and many other aspects of life.  Our overall understanding of biology is one of the reasons we are so advanced, the more we understand about this concept, the more it will benefit us in every aspect of life.

    <p>Human health is a very serious and essential part to life. The healthier we can become, the longer we shall live on this earth. Biology plays a critical role in understanding human health, how our body works, and how we can be the healthiest versions of ourselves.  Biology allows us to better understand things such as genetics, microbiology, and physiology. These fields of studies are all crucial in learning more about diseases and vaccines and treatments that can prevent them. Through biology, experts in medical professional are better equipped and informed on human health so they can make precise decisions in terms of health. This is because biology allows us to better understand our body and how we react to certain things. 
    </p>
        <p>Another key impact biology has on our understandings is the by the topic of Evolution and Adaptation. Evolution is a field of study within biology.  Charles Darwin,  a British naturalist, introduced and discovered the idea of evolution. Evolution. Is the process by which different kinds of organisms developed and adapted from their earlier forms and ancestors into what they are now. Understanding evolution is key to solving biological problems within human lives. Through evolution we can better understand where species come from and what they were in earlier times. Understanding this allows us to picture what our world looked like before human life.
